## What is the Commander X16?

Welcome! 

The Commander X16 is The 8-Bit Guyâ€™s dream computer, designed to evoke the same fondness and nostalgia many of us had for 8-Bit computers, while
retaining closeness to the hardware from a programming perspective, unlike the Raspberry Pi and others. But more than that, it is intended not only as an educational
tool but to solve some of the issues of finding an 8-Bit system to tinker with today; namely ever-increasing costs, auction site price gouging/sniping, lack of 
replacement parts, and unreliability of 30-year old hardware.

The X16 will be made entirely with parts that are still readily available today, ensuring perpetual availability without reliability issues, but in keeping with David's 
vision, it will house a real CPU rather than using emulation or an FPGA recreation of a processor. Running Commodore BASIC V2 (with some additions), the X16 will be 
inexpensive enough to allow a critical mass of users to create an expansive software ecosystem, but simple enough that a single person can understand all of the chips 
and components that allow that software to run.

Three versions of the computer are planned under the "Commander X16" brand umbrella: a "Pro" model, similar to a PC motherboard, a "Console" model similar to an 80s game console, and a "Compact" version focused on size and price.
