# Tok64 codes and Quote Mode

Have you come across a program listing in a magazine and found strange sequences like
`{REVERSE ON}` or `{SPACE * 7}`?

Those are called Tok64 codes. They were a convention started in type-in 
magazines in the 80s, to make it easier to inform users what keys to press for
the "magic" PETSCII control commands on Commodore computers. 

The Tok64 code basically means "press this key". You'll always find these codes
inside of "quoted strings", because they rely on the magic of "quote mode", a
feature unique to Commodore (and now Commander) computers. 

In Commodore BASIC, typing a quote puts you in quote mode, where the editor
types a control character to the screen, rather than acting on it. So in quote
mode, pressing the "Home" key will print an inverse ðŸ†‚ to the screen.

To use quote mode, just press the quote symbol (") while entering a program. 
Then press any control key: change the color with Control+3 or move the cursor
up with the up arrow. You'll get inverse characters, rather than the action.

Pressing the INS (Insert) key also triggers quote mode for 1 character. So you
can use that to quickly insert a single command character.

## Converting Tok64 codes

So how do we make use of this in the Commander 64?

There are two methods: you can simply hand-edit programs once they're on the
Commander, or you can edit the listing if you have the file in ASCII text on
your PC.

### Hand Editing

You can copy and paste code from a text editor or web page directly into the
Commander X16 emulator. Try that now with this example program:

`10 PRINT "{CLEAR}HELLO{REVERSE ON}REVERSE WORLD"`

Select the text with the mouse, right-click, and select **copy**. Then switch
to the emulator, hold Control, and press V.

The line should appear on your screen, but with a large + replacing the { and
a | replacing the }.

Move the cursor to +CLEAR| and use the Delete key to remove it. Then press 
Insert 1 time, hold Control, and press S to clear the screen. 

Do the same thing to replace +Reverse On| with Control+9. 

Finally, if you see something like {SPACE * 20}, that just means "press the
space bar 20 times." You can delete the token code, press the INS key 20 times,
then press ENTER or RETURN to lock in the line. 

### Hex Codes

The other way to get there is to use hex codes on your PC.

Hex codes are the hexadecimal value for a PETSCII symbol. The space bar is \X20,
for example.

Let's start by getting the hex code that matches a token code. Here's a little
program that can help you find the code for anything valid key:

```
10 GET A$:IF A$=""THEN 10
30 PRINT "\X";HEX$(ASC(A$))
40 GOTO 10
```

(Pressing the \ key on your keyboard will print a Â£ on your screen.
This is because the PETSCII value for Â£ is the same as the ASCII value for \.
So instead, press Shift+M to get the \ symbol.)

RUN this and type the HOME key. You should see \X13. Press Shift+HOME. You should
see \X93.

Now you can get the hex code of any Tok64 code by simply running this program
and pressing the key. 

So let's review our example line:

`10 PRINT "{CLEAR}HELLO{REVERSE ON}REVERSE WORLD"`

Paste that into Notepad and alter it to look like this:

`10 PRINT "\X93HELLO\X12REVERSE WORLD"`

Copy and paste that into the emulator, and you should see a heart instead of
\X93 and an inverse R instead of \X12. 

RUN it.

And that's all there is to that.

| {right}      | \X1D |
| {left}       | \X9D |
| {down}       | \X11 |
| {up}         | \X91 |
